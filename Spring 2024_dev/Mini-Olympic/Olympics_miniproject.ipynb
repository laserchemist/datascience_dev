The format differs from a weekly lab in that you will develop your own notebook below. You will create all the notebook code and use extensive markdown to document the process and your observations.

    "### Overview\n",
    "In celebration of the Olympic spirit we will analyze trends in a data set which spans the from the 1896 Athens games to Rio in 2016. With this data we will explore trends in medals awarded, sports, and countries, as well as any host country advantage. The dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com ), a Data science dataset, coding, and competition site. The mini- project represents your first chance to try out your coding and data skills to address specific questions without template code. Look to your previous labs and our work in class for ideas.\n",
    "We will limit our project to data from the Winter Olympics by using the where method [.where(\"Season\",\"Winter\") ] which leaves us with 18,923 individual athletes and 48,564 athlete/event datapoints (Many athletes compete in multiple events and/or over multiple Olympics).
